# MedicurePlus

This is our final year project on the use of machine learning in heath industry.

# Collaborators' handbook

* Collaborators are requested not to make or push changes directly into the main/master branch. Create a new branch for you using your own name or your group name for example: frontend, backend, model designing, ask the project leader(Souvik Ghosh) to check the changes, then commit it.
* Fronend and backend collaborators will have their own directories.
* If there is any need of using any secrets(ex: api key, anon key), use a **.env** file for security precautions.

# Project Completion

Create a deadline of project submission in this github to avoid any last time changes.
